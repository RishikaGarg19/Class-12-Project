Studies have shown that around 80% of any fitness goal depends on your diet, be it weight loss, muscular development or training for an event. <BR>
Eating a good balance of clean carbohydrates, fresh protein and healthy fats will give you the energy to aid your fitness challenge and show results quickly. <BR>
For the most part, when being coached for weight loss and definition, it is advised to eat three meals and two snacks to help keep the metabolism burning at a constant rate. <BR> </P> </LI>
