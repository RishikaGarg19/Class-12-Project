<P> 'Underweight' is a term describing a person whose body weight is considered too low to be healthy. <BR>
The definition usually refers to people with a body mass index (BMI) of under 18.5 or a weight 15% to 20% below that normal for their age and height group. Being underweight can damage your health. Weighing too little can contribute to a weakened immune system, fragile bones and feeling tired. </P>
<P> If you're concerned about being underweight, check your body mass index (BMI) using our <A href="http://localhost/bmi.PHP">BMI calculator</A> . </BR>
If your BMI is below the healthy range (>18.5), this suggests that your weight may be too low. <BR>
If you're underweight, your GP (general physician) or practice nurse can give you help and advice. There might be an underlying medical cause for your low weight, such as an overactive thyroid. <BR> </P> <BR> <CENTER>
